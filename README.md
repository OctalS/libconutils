libconutils 1.0
===============

libconutils is a small and simple Linux C++ library for providing
basic tools to write console graphics applications using ASCII characters.
It can be used for example for:
 * Programs that need console window oriented interface.
 * Text editors
 * Console based games
 * ...

The library target is to provide a very simple interface for quick development.
It does not depend on anything more that the standard C/C++ library.
It is NOT a substitute of ncuruses library. If you need something serious and portable
for production then you should rather stop here and use ncurses.
This is primary written for fun.
